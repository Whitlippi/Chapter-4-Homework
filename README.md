Chapter-4-Homework
==================

Problem 9) 15 mysterySum(4) is 12 so mysterySum(5) is 15
Problem 11) 6 multiplications are preformed 
Problem 18) 4 times   split it up into 3 groups each time to compare weights

Other Problem:    I dont remember a search function ever being explicitly mentioned or defined in the chapter. 
There are, however, 2 ways that searches are processed which are discussed. There is a sequential search, which is used 
when the list is not in order and looks at the data until it finds a match. There is also the binary search makes 
way less comparisons over huge lists. Binary seaches are for lists that are in order and kind of works like porblem 18 
where you narrow it down each time to seeing if it is greater than or less than the number you choose on the list and and
eliminating the area it was not in from the rest of the search.  A search of a list of 1,000,000 could take up to 1,000,000 
comparisons if you had to use a sequential search, but when you use a bianry search it only takes up 20 comparisons. That
is a big difference; 999,980 comparisons less. For 10,000 it takes up to 15 rather than the 10,000.
